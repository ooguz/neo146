neo146 - connect like it's 1984
===============================

neo146 provides a minimal (and experimental!) information gateway that serves
as an emergency network connection method inspired by dial-up, allowing you to
access content via certain protocols. The current implementations are HTTP-SMS
gateway and HTTP-Markdown gateway.

The name "neo146" comes from the Turkish historic public dial-up service, which
operated on dial number 146. This project is created within a few days to 
support the protesters during the 19 March 2025 uprising in Turkey, following 
the arrest of the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu who is the opposition's 
presidental candidate. 

The service is free, but running it costs about 20 EUR per month, and also 5-20
cents per message for the SMS gateway; please use responsibly. For supporting 
the service and a better experience, please consider donating and subscribing.

SMS responses are base64 encoded for using less SMS credits. Multiple messages
are used to send longer responses, the sequence of messages is indicated in the
response as "GW<number>|" prefix.

HTTP responses are not encoded by default, but can be requested with b64=true
parameter.
